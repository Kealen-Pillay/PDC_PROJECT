- Welcome to the virtual pet game! We hope you take care of your little buddy.
- Once you have adopted your virtual pet, it will be your responsibility to take care of your new friend!
- Your new pet will have various skills such as; swimming, speed and flight.
- Depending on the pet you adopt, some pets have better skills and worse skills than others.
- You may choose to enter your pet into races including: swimming, speed or flight.
- If your pet wins the race, you will be rewarded with money which you may save to evolve your pet and make it more skilled.
- Entering your pet into a race will cause it too lose health and energy.
- It will be your responsibility to ensure your pet is full of energy and healthy by feeding them pellets.
- Feeding your pet a pellet will restore 1 energy bar. 
- When your pet is at full energy, it's health will begin to increase when fed.
- You can earn pellets by answering basic math questions.
- Each pet has a unique power that can be used, but be conservative as each power only has 3 uses.
- Be sure to keep your pet well fed to keep it from dying. (Death of pet will end game)
- Have Fun!
